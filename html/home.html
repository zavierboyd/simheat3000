    <h1>Home</h1>
    <p>This is a tool to simulate the amount of money and energy you save by insulating parts of your house.</p>
    <p>To make this tool work you first need to go to the "Room simulation" page and input the data it ask you for. Then hit
    the submit button and the simulation will analyse your data and simulate your house with your main room being heated
     to 18C and the rest of your house not being heated. It will give you the amount of energy and money you use to heat
     that room up for one year.<p/>
    <h3>Under Development</h3>
    <p>The Room simulation page is still under development and will become easier to use in the future.</p>
    <p>Making it so that in the Draw floor plan page you can draw your floor plan and you would get the amount of energy
    you might use in a year.</p>
    <p>Making this website mobile compatible.</p>
